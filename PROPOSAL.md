# [BlackJack]

Author: [John Wachala]

For the final project, I wanted to make Game of Blackjack using a GUI for a visual
experience. The game would load up to a menu where a player could start the game.
They could play against the dealer until they run out of chips using the user interface, or they could leave the table, 
and their profits would be reported at an endgame screen.

I wanted to do this project because though we have implemented several portions of
games in the past, I’ve never experienced building a full game. I was never able to get the
Crazy 8’s game working correctly, and attempting another card game, with full GUI,
gameplay, music, menus, and user interface would be a fun experience giving me
another shot to improve on what I couldn’t do the first time, with a lot more features.

The game’s GUI/User Interface would utilize the cinder block [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the visuals of the game,
which I made sure was compatible with Cmake and Clion. By the first week, I would like to have
the full design of the project mapped out, with a basic menu screen that will get the player from
menu to a GUI table while I work out how ImGui works. By the second week I would implement
the card system and engine to begin the game flow, and run a visual game of BlackJack. By the
third week I would like to have implemented the extra features such as music, sound effects, fixed bugs
and any additional components I find are needed throughout production. If I have
extra time, I could add in extra players to the table, a tipping system to the dealer that increases
a players odds at winning, or special abilities such as “cheating” to give the player a leg up
during some rounds. I could also add a slot machine as a minigame to give the game a casino. Further additions
could include a Tip system where a player can get hints on a good strategy to maximize wins.
